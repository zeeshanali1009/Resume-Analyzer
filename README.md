## 📄 Resume‑Analyzer — Project 

**Resume‑Analyzer** is a Python‑based AI‑powered tool designed to help job seekers and recruiters quickly evaluate and improve resumes. The application processes uploaded resumes, extracts relevant text and features, and evaluates them against hiring criteria such as skills, experience, and compatibility with job requirements. It can rank resumes, score them, and provide meaningful insights that help users enhance their resume quality and increase their chances of landing interviews.

This kind of system is especially useful for:

* Job seekers who want fast, automated review and optimization suggestions.
* Recruiters and hiring teams who need initial screening assistance at scale.
* Career platforms looking to embed resume evaluation into their services.

The project likely uses key techniques like **text extraction**, **NLP (natural language processing)**, and **similarity scoring** to analyze resumes and return actionable feedback. ([GitHub][1])

### 🧠 Key Capabilities (Typical for a Resume Analyzer)

* **Resume Upload & Parsing:** Supports common formats like PDF, DOCX, and TXT. ([GitHub][1])
* **Text Extraction:** Extracts text from resumes for further analysis. ([GitHub][1])
* **AI or NLP‑Driven Scoring:** Uses techniques such as TF‑IDF and cosine similarity to score resumes against job descriptions. ([GitHub][1])
* **Rank & Recommend:** Ranks resumes by relevance, highlights strengths/weaknesses, and suggests areas for improvement. ([GitHub][1])
* **Web Interface (if included):** Could offer a simple web UI for uploading and viewing results. ([GitHub][1])

### 💡 Why This Tool Matters

Modern recruiting often uses **automated screening systems** (like ATS) that filter resumes quickly. A resume analyzer helps bridge the gap between raw resumes and screening systems by:

* Identifying missing keywords and essential sections.
* Providing structured feedback rather than simple text output.
* Saving time for both applicants and hiring teams.
